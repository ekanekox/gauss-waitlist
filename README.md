# Gauss

**Diagnóstico certo de primeira**

Gauss is an AI-powered diagnostic assistant designed to help automotive mechanics identify problems faster and with greater precision. Think of it as having a specialist for every vehicle brand in your pocket.

## What is Gauss?

Gauss leverages artificial intelligence to assist mechanics in diagnosing vehicle issues more efficiently. By analyzing symptoms and vehicle information, it provides probable causes ranked by likelihood, along with suggested diagnostic tests.

## Key Benefits

- **50% faster** diagnostics
- **30% fewer errors** in problem identification
- Expert-level assistance for all vehicle makes and models

## How It Works

Mechanics describe the vehicle symptoms (e.g., "Honda Civic 2015, suspension noise when going over speed bumps, left side"), and Gauss provides:

1. Ranked list of most probable causes with confidence percentages
2. Suggested diagnostic tests to pinpoint the exact issue
3. Specific guidance based on the vehicle make, model, and year

## Example

**Input:** Honda Civic 2015, suspension noise when going over speed bumps, left side

**Output:**
1. Lower control arm bushing (87%)
2. Steering tie rod end (62%)
3. Shock absorber bump stop (45%)

💡 **Suggested test:** Bounce the vehicle with your hand on the suspension to locate the exact point.
